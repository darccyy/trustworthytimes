This just in! Volunteer Firefighter Georg Eustis claims that he beat up and assaulted old people.
Did he do it for fun? No. That would be awful.
Eustis pins the blame on his boss, King of Firefighters, Henny Schneck, who allegedly told Eustis to, quote:

> go to the ol' folks home, and, hehe, yu' know, give them the old 'punch in the face'

This is utterly abhorrent behavior, especially coming from the King (of Firefighters).

Eustis will still, however, be receiving his Trophy for Great Work, for some reason, even after Schneck is replaced.

If you see firefighters assaulting the elderly, please phone this number: `1800-HELP!-ASSAULT!`
