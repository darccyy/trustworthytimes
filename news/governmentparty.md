The entire world's government has just shut down because of a crazy party that happened the night before.


This is of course Bad News. The worlds supply of government has just run out, as it was already a limited resource.

The party in question was a large amount of general ruckus, with all the members of the government there. All of the individuals involved are now either hungover, jailed, or dead.


Sources state that there is suspicion that Big Anarchy was behind the ordeal, as now the world is in a state of anarchy.

This is, however, possibly only a rumour perpetrated by Big Control, in order to convince the people of the world to not do the anarchy.

On the other hand, this rumour could be created by Big Anarchy to make Big Control seem cringe and bad.


Who can know? In a day of such things, such as /Technology/, /Innovation/, and /Governmental Collapse/, there is no way in telling what is the right thing (And, in turn, what is the wrong thing, based on what happens to be the right thing)
