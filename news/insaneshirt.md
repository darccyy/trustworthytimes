This seemingly mentally unstable person has just purchased a standard garment of the colo{opacity: 0.5}[u]r red from the popular retail store Tergat, and people are freaking out.

Although there is no solid evidence as to if this person is legitimately crazy, it is pretty clear from the fact that they bought such an item.

Rather weird.
